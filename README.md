# Redux quiz group project

This project is a Moive quiz created with React and Redux. It is a collaboration by Johan LÃ¶fgren, Shaun Newmark and Erika Andersson Porath, and was made during two project days with some minor finishing up later.

## The problem

We started by making a sketch in Figma to figure out what components and some of the design we wanted to have. 
Then we used mob-programming to write the code. We started by making one component with all the code and in the end broke it up into smaller components. 
After the functionality were set we did the styling. The disabling of the next-button, the addition of the restart-button and responsiveness was done after the two days of the project was over, but it felt nice to finish up the last parts a bit anyway. 
When we needed help we called for the code coaches we had at hand. Otherwise we searched for solutions on the web and peeked at others project to see if anyone had found a good solution for the problem we ran into. However, most of it we solved by ourselves by some trail and error and simple problem solving. 
Our major issue were to understand how the useSelector worked, but once that maked sence everything went pretty smooth.

If we had more time we would add more conditional functionality.
