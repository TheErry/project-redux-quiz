# Redux quiz group project

This project is a Moive quiz created with react and redux.

## The problem

Our major issue were to understand how the useSelector worked, but once that maked sence everything went pretty smooth. 
If we had more time we would add more conditional functionality and present the result a bit different. 
There are also some minor styling left. 

## View it live
